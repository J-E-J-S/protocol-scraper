Gel Electrophoresis
Materials:
None
Steps:
1. In a large glass bottle, add  DI water.
2. Add  50x TAE buffer to the deionized water.
3. Cap the bottle and mix by swirling
4. Pour  TAE buffer into microwavable glass bottle.
5. Add the following amount of agarose powder to TAE buffer for different gel concentrations:  AB1Concentration (w/v)Agarose (g)22.0%632.5%7.543%9
6. Microwave in  intervals until completely dissolved, swirling bottle between heating intervals.
7. Pour into gel mold with well insert. Add to black line (~)
8. Allow gel to set for approximately .
9. Transfer gel boat with gel into electrophoresis chamber.
10. Add buffer to line marked on chamber, completely covering the gel.
11. Carefully load the wells with ladder (green) and amplification product solutions at volumes between  and .
12. Put the lid on the chamber, turn on the power supply and press 'RUN'. Run for .
13. Transfer the gel into the dying tray.
14. Check buffer level and add more if necessary.
15. Add  ethidium bromide to dying tray.
16. Turn on stage, and allow to stain for .
17. Place gel in imaging machine.
18. Turn on the machine by the switch on left side of machine. Press 'Trans UV'.
19. Take a picture with the camera.
